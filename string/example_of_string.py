# Reverse a String
# Write a Python program that takes a string as input and prints the reversed version of the string.

a = str(input("enter characters : "))
print (a[::-1])
# 2. Check for Palindrome
# Write a program that checks if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forward and backward).

if a == a[::-1]:
    print (True)
else:
    print (False)


# 3. Count Vowels in a String
# Write a Python program that counts how many vowels (a, e, i, o, u) appear in a given string.


# 4. Remove Duplicates from a String

# 5. Find the Longest Word in a String

# 6. Count Occurrences of a Substring
# Write a Python program that counts the number of occurrences of a given substring in a string.

# 7. Remove All Whitespaces from a String

# 8. Convert a String to Title Case
# Write a Python program that converts a string to title case (first letter of each word capitalized).


# 9. Swap Case
# Write a program that swaps the case of all characters in a string (lowercase to uppercase and vice versa).


# 10. Check if Two Strings are Anagrams
# Write a program that checks if two strings are anagrams (contain the same characters in any order).

# Bonus Problem: String Compression
# Write a Python program that performs basic string compression, where repeated characters are replaced by the character and its count.
